# Project Title "Exploring Capabilities of Vision Transformer in Cancer Classification using Biomedical Data: Comparison with Traditional Approaches."

## Project Description
This project aims to leverage Vision Transformers (ViT) for the classification of lung cancer stages (Benign, Normal, Malignant) using biomedical data. We compare the performance of ViT with traditional machine learning approaches, evaluating metrics like accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. The goal is to improve early diagnosis and treatment planning for better patient outcomes.

A comparative study of Vision Transformer (ViT) and traditional ML models (SVM, CNN) for classifying lung cancer stages (Normal/Benign/Malignant) using IQ-OTH/NCCD CT scans. Focuses on improving diagnostic accuracy via k-fold cross-validation. Code, datasets, and results included.

## Execution Steps
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather lung cancer datasets from diverse biomedical sources.
   - Select the most suitable dataset for the project.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean data by removing vulgarity, duplicates, and irrelevant entries.
   - Handle missing/unknown values through deletion or imputation.
   - Normalize/standardize features as needed.

3. **Model Development**  
   - Implement a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for cancer stage classification (Benign/Normal/Malignant).
   - Compare with traditional ML approaches (e.g., CNN, SVM, Random Forest).

4. **Prediction & Treatment Planning**  
   - Predict cancer stages to enable early intervention.
   - Provide insights for improving patient recovery rates.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Assess model performance using:
     - Accuracy
     - F1-Score
     - Precision
     - Recall
